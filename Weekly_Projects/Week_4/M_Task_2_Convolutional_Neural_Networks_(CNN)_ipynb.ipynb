        "1. **Data Preprocessing**: Explain why you chose your specific data preprocessing techniques (e.g., resizing images, normalization, data augmentation). How do these preprocessing steps improve the performance of your CNN model?\n",
        "2. **Model Architecture**: Describe the architecture of your CNN model (e.g., number of convolutional layers, kernel sizes, pooling layers). Why did you choose this structure, and how do you expect each layer to contribute to feature extraction?\n",
        "3. **Activation Functions**: Justify your choice of activation functions. How do they influence the training and output of your CNN?\n",
        "4. **Training Process**: Discuss your choice of batch size, number of epochs, and optimizer. How did these decisions impact the training process and the convergence of the model?\n",
        "5. **Loss Function and Metrics**: Explain why you chose the specific loss function and evaluation metrics for this classification task. How do they align with the goal of correctly classifying traffic signs?\n",
        "6. **Regularization Techniques**: If you used regularization methods like dropout or batch normalization, explain why you implemented them and how they helped prevent overfitting in your model.\n",
        "7. **Model Evaluation**: Justify the method you used to evaluate your model's performance on the test set. Why did you select these evaluation techniques, and what insights did they provide about your model's accuracy and generalization ability?\n",
        "8. **Model Visualization**: Explain the significance of the performance visualizations (e.g., accuracy and loss curves). What do they tell you about your model's training process and its ability to generalize?\n",
        "9. **Overfitting and Underfitting**: Analyze whether the model encountered any overfitting or underfitting during training. What strategies could you implement to mitigate these issues?"
